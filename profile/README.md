## Who are we
We a group of dedicated Minecraft: Earth fans who are trying to recreate the server so that you can still play MCE even post-sunset

## Current progress
- [x] Create Project Earth Setup Utility
- [x] Reverse engineer Project Earth API via mitmproxy
  - [x] Create API documenation (somewhat done)
  - [ ] Create JS replacement API (in progress)
- [ ] Reverse engineer Project Earth Cloudburst Protocol via custom MC proxy
